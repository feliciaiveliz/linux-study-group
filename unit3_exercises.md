1. Use brace expansion to create a series of directories, running from `dir001` to `dir100`. Ensure the numerical portion of each directory has the appropriate amount of leading zeros.

1. As above, use brace expansion to create a series of directories with leading zeros from `skip001` to `skip100`, but this time only every 4th number should result in a directory. For example, the first three directories in the series will be `skip001`, `skip005`, and `skip009`. The final directory will be `skip097`.

1. Use brace expansion to print the following to stdout: `test01{} test02{} test03{}`. 

1. Enter `env` to print a list of environmental variables. Identify a few that interest you and practice parameter expansion by echoing their values to stdout.
