# Unit 3: Expansion and Keyboard Tricks

The previous unit looked at redirection and pipelines, two very powerful features of Linux and the Bash shell. The first part of this unit will look at another powerful Bash feature: expansion. Expansion allows us to make our Bash commands dynamic.


The second part of this unit is about typing and editing shell commands more efficiently. We will cover _readline_ keyboard shortcuts, command auto-completion, and searching our command history.

The topics in this unit are not particularly deep, but mastering them will make you a much more efficient user of your shell, and they will demystify many of the more complex commands that you may come across in your career.

The next unit will cover a deeper topic: processes and their environments, and we'll connect this with the world of Ruby application development.
